## Appendix : How to create a swap file
<br/>
1.It creates a swap 4Gbyte file in /var/swap.  

```text
$ sudo mkdir /var/swap/
$ sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/var/swap/swap0 bs=2M count=2048
$ sudo chmod 600 /var/swap/swap
```  

<br/>
2.It allocates a swap file for swap space.  

```text
$ sudo mkswap /var/swap/swap0
$ sudo swapon /var/swap/swap0
```  

<br/>
3.It enables swap space at OS startup and that all.  

```text
$ sudo vi /etc/fstab
It adds the following to the last line of the fstab file:
/var/swap/swap0 swap swap defaults 0 0
```
